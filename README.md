You just need to download the application from the [release page](https://github.com/drpetersonfernandes/SimpleLauncher/releases), then extract the zip file to your chosen folder.

## Usage

* Click on the Edit System on the top menu.

* Create a folder inside images folder with the same name of the System you just created.
* Put all your cover images for that specific System inside that folder.
* Now you select the System in the dropdown menu on top of the app.
* Select the Emulator you want to use.

## Where to Find Game Covers:

We do NOT provide ROMs, ISOs or Game Covers.<br>
You can find cover images on websites such as [Libretro Thumbnails](https://github.com/libretro-thumbnails/libretro-thumbnails) or [EmuMovies](https://emumovies.com). However, please note that these sites are not affiliated with Simple Launcher.

## List of Parameters for Emulators

You can check a list of parameters gathered by us for each emulator. Click [here](https://github.com/drpetersonfernandes/SimpleLauncher/wiki/parameters) to see the list.<br>
There are special cases that need to be detailed, like adding Windows Games and Sony Playstation 3 Games into the Frontend. Click [here](https://github.com/drpetersonfernandes/SimpleLauncher/wiki#special-settings) to see the details.

## Additional Features:

- **Update Notifications:** You will be notified if a new version is available.
- **Error Logging:** The application also has an error logging mechanism that notifies the developers of any errors that occur. This way, we can fix bugs and improve the program over time.
